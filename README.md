# RasterReprojection
Reprojects raster from a projected, geographic, or geolocated raster (2D or 3D) to a different projection or geographic raster, or to the same projection with a different cell size (there is no option for output geolocated raster). If you just want to use the code (rather than edit and create branch in github) I recommend installing using Raster Reprojection.mltbx.
